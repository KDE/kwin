This file describes how to set up kwin_composite. Note that since it is still
a work in progress, this file may possibly get out of date at times.


See file HACKING for details on developing KWin, including building
    the kwin_composite branch.
See file COMPOSITE_TODO for a list of things that still need to be done.
See effects/howto.* for a HOWTO on writting effects.
See documentation in source (mainly in scene.cpp) for description
    of the design of the compositing framework.

Using kwin_composite branch:
============================

See the KDE trunk HOWTO at http://developer.kde.org/build/trunk.html .

The simplest way to build the kwin_composite branch is to switch the trunk version
to the branch:

$ cd kdebase/workspace/kwin
$ svn info
(prints the repository URL, for example https://svn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/kdebase/workspace/kwin)
$ svn switch https://svn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/work/kwin_composite
(i.e. replace trunk/KDE/kdebase/workspace/kwin with branches/work/kwin_composite)
$ make
(i.e. build and use it as usually)

After starting, KWin's debug output also says which compositing backend it uses, e.g.
"OpenGL compositing". If it does not, most probably your X is not configured properly.


nVidia:
-----------

Both 9xxx and 8xxx drivers work, only 9xxx drivers provide TFP (texture_from_pixmap)
functionality.

You need in xorg.conf

Option "AddARGBGLXVisuals" "True"

in 'Section "Screen"' and also the XComposite extension enabled:

Section "Extensions"
 Option "Composite" "Enable"
EndSection


ATI:
--------

The radeon driver should work for R200 chips, it's worse with R300 chips.
TODO - fglrx - no idea

You need in xorg.conf the XComposite extension enabled:

Section "Extensions"
 Option "Composite" "Enable"
EndSection

Also using

Option "XaaNoOffscreenPixmaps" "true"

in 'Section "Screen"' may improve performance for non-TFP (texture_from_pixmap) modes.

For the TFP mode AIGLX needs to work. With AIGLX direct rendering should be be disabled
(see GLDirect below, with X.org older than 7.2 "export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1" before
running kwin may be necessary).


Intel:
-------

TODO - no idea. Possibly similar to ATI.


Configuration options:
----------------------

All general configuration option are in group [Translucency] in kwinrc config file:

UseTranslucency=<true|false> - enables/disables compositing support
GLMode=<TFP|SHM|Fallback> - selects texture creating mode
RefreshRate=<number> - manually specified refresh rate, should be usually automatically detected
GLAlwaysRebind=<true|false> - may increase speed with some graphics cards
GLDirect=<true|false> - enables/disables direct rendering
GLVSync=<true|false> - enables/disables synchronizing with monitor refresh

ShowFPSEffect:
Options are in group [EffectShowFps] in kwinrc config file:
Alpha=<number 0.0-1.0> - transparency
X=<number> - X position, negative is from the right edge, -10000 is exactly right edge
Y=<number> = Y position, the same like X


Effects:
--------

Which modules are enabled is currently set by config value Load in group [Effects] in kwinrc config file.
Effects are named like the class, without the Effect suffix (e.g. Load=ShowFps,Fade). There is
no depedency checking implemented yet.
