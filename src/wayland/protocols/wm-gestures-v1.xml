  <interface name="xdg_wm_gestures_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="Generic framework to attach WM behavior">
      The xdg_wm_gestures_v1 interface is exposed as a global object,
      it allows clients to notify the compositor of gestures (or actions)
      happening on portions of the toplevel that would tie in to window
      management logic.

      This WM gesture mechanism is kept open and high-level on purpose, so that
      compositors may apply global policies and behaviors (e.g. middle-click
      lowering windows) to get a common look and feel across clients.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.
