  <interface name="wp_pointer_warp_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="warp the pointer to a location on a surface">
      This global interface allows applications to request the pointer to be
      moved to a position relative to a wl_surface.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

        Request the compositor to move the pointer to a surface-local position.
        Whether or not the compositor honors the request is implementation defined,
        it may for example ignore it if the surface doesn't have keyboard or pointer
        focus, or if the serial of the last enter event isn't correct.

        If the requested position is outside of the surface bounds, the
        out_of_bounds_position error is emitted.
