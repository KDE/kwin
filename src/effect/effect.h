/** @defgroup kwineffects KWin effects library
 * KWin effects library contains necessary classes for creating new KWin
 * compositing effects.
 *
 * @section creating Creating new effects
 * This example will demonstrate the basics of creating an effect. We'll use
 *  CoolEffect as the class name, cooleffect as internal name and
 *  "Cool Effect" as user-visible name of the effect.
 *
 * This example doesn't demonstrate how to write the effect's code. For that,
 *  see the documentation of the Effect class.
 *
 * @subsection creating-class CoolEffect class
 * First you need to create CoolEffect class which has to be a subclass of
 *  @ref KWin::Effect. In that class you can reimplement various virtual
 *  methods to control how and where the windows are drawn.
 *
 * @subsection creating-macro KWIN_EFFECT_FACTORY macro
 * This library provides a specialized KPluginFactory subclass and macros to
 * create a sub class. This subclass of KPluginFactory has to be used, otherwise
 * KWin won't load the plugin. Use the @ref KWIN_EFFECT_FACTORY macro to create the
 * plugin factory. This macro will take the embedded json metadata filename as the second argument.
 *
 * @subsection creating-buildsystem Buildsystem
 * To build the effect, you can use the kcoreaddons_add_plugin cmake macro which
 *  takes care of creating the library and installing it.
 *  The first parameter is the name of the library, this is the same as the id of the plugin.
 *  If our effect's source is in cooleffect.cpp, we'd use following:
 * @code
 *     kcoreaddons_add_plugin(cooleffect SOURCES cooleffect.cpp INSTALL_NAMESPACE "kwin/effects/plugins")
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection creating-json-metadata Effect's .json file for embedded metadata
 * The format follows the one of the @see KPluginMetaData class.
 *
 * Example cooleffect.json file:
 * @code
{
    "KPlugin": {
        "Authors": [
            {
                "Email": "my@email.here",
                "Name": "My Name"
            }
        ],
        "Category": "Misc",
        "Description": "The coolest effect you've ever seen",
        "Icon": "preferences-system-windows-effect-cooleffect",
        "Name": "Cool Effect"
    }
}
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section accessing Accessing windows and workspace
 * Effects can gain access to the properties of windows and workspace via
 *  EffectWindow and EffectsHandler classes.
 *
 * There is one global EffectsHandler object which you can access using the
 *  @ref effects pointer.
 * For each window, there is an EffectWindow object which can be used to read
 *  window properties such as position and also to change them.
 *
 * For more information about this, see the documentation of the corresponding
 *  classes.

/**
 * @short Base class for all KWin effects
 *
 * This is the base class for all effects. By reimplementing virtual methods
 *  of this class, you can customize how the windows are painted.
 *
 * The virtual methods are used for painting and need to be implemented for
 * custom painting.
 *
 * In order to react to state changes (e.g. a window gets closed) the effect
 * should provide slots for the signals emitted by the EffectsHandler.
 *
 * @section Chaining
 * Most methods of this class are called in chain style. This means that when
 *  effects A and B area active then first e.g. A::paintWindow() is called and
 *  then from within that method B::paintWindow() is called (although
 *  indirectly). To achieve this, you need to make sure to call corresponding
 *  method in EffectsHandler class from each such method (using @ref effects
 *  pointer):
 * @code
 *  void MyEffect::postPaintScreen()
 *  {
 *      // Do your own processing here
 *      ...
 *      // Call corresponding EffectsHandler method
 *      effects->postPaintScreen();
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section Effectsptr Effects pointer
 * @ref effects pointer points to the global EffectsHandler object that you can
 *  use to interact with the windows.
 *
 * @section painting Painting stages
 * Painting of windows is done in three stages:
 * @li First, the prepaint pass.<br>
 *  Here you can specify how the windows will be painted, e.g. that they will
 *  be translucent and transformed.
 * @li Second, the paint pass.<br>
 *  Here the actual painting takes place. You can change attributes such as
 *  opacity of windows as well as apply transformations to them. You can also
 *  paint something onto the screen yourself.
 * @li Finally, the postpaint pass.<br>
 *  Here you can mark windows, part of windows or even the entire screen for
 *  repainting to create animations.
 *
 * For each stage there are *Screen() and *Window() methods. The window method
 *  is called for every window while the screen method is usually called just
 *  once.
 *
 * @section OpenGL
 * Effects can use OpenGL if EffectsHandler::isOpenGLCompositing() returns @c true.
 * The OpenGL context may not always be current when code inside the effect is
 * executed. The framework ensures that the OpenGL context is current when the Effect
 * gets created, destroyed or reconfigured and during the painting stages. All virtual
 * methods which have the OpenGL context current are documented.
 *
 * If OpenGL code is going to be executed outside the painting stages, e.g. in reaction
 * to a global shortcut, it is the task of the Effect to make the OpenGL context current:
 * @code
 * effects->makeOpenGLContextCurrent();
 * @endcode
 *
 * There is in general no need to call the matching doneCurrent method.
